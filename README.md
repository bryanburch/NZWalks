# NZWalks
This is an ASP.NET Core Web API (.NET 8) demo project. There's no UI (besides Swagger) for consuming the API, and is just an exercise in building an API.

## Running the project
Open the project in Visual Studio 2022 and click on the green button labeled "https" to run in debug mode.

A "Swagger" dashboard webpage should be opened in a new browser window. If not, check the launchSettings.json file and make sure your preferred web browser is selected. The different resources are displayed here, grouped by controller. You can navigate through the different URIs and test them out from here.
